# Sensor Data Visualization Project

This project visualizes sensor data fetched from a database and displays it on a web dashboard. It uses Flask for the web backend and frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database. The data includes temperature and humidity readings, which are processed to calculate averages, and max/min values. This data is then plotted and displayed on the dashboard.

## Prerequisites

## Directory Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project directory structure:

- **server**: Contains the server scripts including the one to initialize the database (`table.py`).
- **backend**: Contains the backend server logic for data processing and API endpoints.
- **client**: Houses the frontend Flask application that displays the dashboard to users.
- **plots**: A folder to store generated plots.
- **templates**: Contains HTML templates used by the client Flask app.
- **docker-compose.yml**: The docker-compose configuration file.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/munishreddy1/python_docker.git
   cd PROJECT_DIRECTORY
   ```

2. **Build and Start the Containers**:

   Due to dependencies between the services, it's essential to start them in the correct order. Follow these commands:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d db
   ```

   Wait for a few seconds to ensure the database is fully initialized.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d init_db
   ```

   This step initializes the table structure. The script waits for 10 seconds before executing to make sure the database is ready to accept connections.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d server
   docker-compose up -d backend
   docker-compose up -d client
   ```

3. **Access the Dashboard**:

   After starting all services, you can access the dashboard by navigating to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5001/
   ```

   Here, you'll see processed sensor data and a plot.
